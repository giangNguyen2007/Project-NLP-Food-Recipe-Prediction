hard to make i promise you this as a former kitchen assassin turned food lover to make stock: bring 3 l of water to a boil in a 4 6 l pot add the chicken frames a good dash of salt and the bay leaves you will add more salt later but this helps to extract the maximum flavor from the chicken reduce heat to simmer for 1 hour covered skimming occasionally do not simmer for too much longer than this or the bones start to decalcify and make the stock bitter flavoured in the meantime: clean and rough chop 2 5 kg of potatos set aside clean and rough chop 1 large leek set aside you re going to puree it

until white and cooked through about 3 4 minutes add the tomatoes beans garlic and corn season with salt and pepper cook for 2 3 minutes add all of the spices and the adobo sauce add chicken stock you may want more or less chicken stock depending on your desired consistency i like mine fairly thick bring to a boil reduce to a rapid simmer simmer for about 30 60 minutes all up to you the longer and lower temperature the better add corn meal and cheese to thicken a little at a time stir rapidly to avoid lumps simmer for another 15 minutes or so you may need to add more corn meal and or cheese to obtain your desired thickness check for seasoning you may want to add more salt and pepper to fit your taste also add more cayenne or chili powder for heat and depth once the desired thickness and seasoning is achieved the chili is technically ready to serve i often like to turn the heat down to low and cook longer anywhere from 15 minutes to hours this continues to intensify the flavors and thicken the chili serve in a bowl with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro scallions cheddar cheese and a spoonful of sour cream fresh corn tortillas cornbread and garlic jalapeno focaccia bread go well with this also you can vary this in any way often i ll use shredded rotisserie chicken or different types of beans also you can omit the tomatoes adobo sauce and red powders all together and use roasted seeded and peeled green chiles if you like more of that east coat midwestern style chili use ground chicken or turkey and add some tomato paste instead of the cheese cornmeal to thicken you can also omit the meat altogether and add extra beans vegetables this recipe also works well in the crock pot left cooking all day using dried soaked beans i like the health benefits of this myself | | | | | |

starts to cool a little it is ready to frost the cake wait 10 15 minutes for this to occur while frosting keep this in mind: frosting tends to separate make sure that you keep the frosting homogenous while frosting frosting is very thin so it will fall off of the cake make sure to frost on the platter that you will serve the cake on also keep reapplying the frosting that falls off until almost all is reabsorbed fresh coconut will stick to sides and syrup will absorb into cake this is the most moist delicious yummy cake in the world perfect for an anniversary or holiday | | | | | | | | | | | | |

little warm water first add: 4 cups of 100% whole grain wheat flour mix until the consistency is some what even then continue to slowly add flour 1 2 cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl it should be tacky to the touch the trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy it will most likely be 6 1 2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1 2 cups of wheat flour you can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish don t over mix or the bread will be tough when your dough is finished leave it in the mixer cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30 45 minutes the dough will be larger but it doesn t need to double grease two bread pans with crisco you can also flour the pans to reduce sticking mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn t sticky divide the ball in half and do it again shape the loaves by turning the dough under it s self over and over when the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled bake

and a towel and let it sit for 45 minutes to an hour in a warm place it should be bubbly the dough: add the 2 cups water 2 cups whole wheat flour dry milk wheat gluten salt sugar and oil mix until combined heres where you learn how to make bread start to add your remaining flour i add one cup at a time but you can do it by the half a cup 2 cups might be enough but it could go up to 4 cups fully incorporate the flour you add before adding more whole wheat bread will still be a little sticky and a little stiff carefully judge when you think you have enough once you make bread enough youll know when its enough flour you can always add more flour when you re kneading kneading: by hand 20 to 30 minutes in a mixer 10 minutes i suggest the bread mixer the first time i made this i did it by hand because whole wheat is heavier i could only last about 2 minutes i baked it but this was not a light textured bread the second time i did it for 10 in my mixer wow what a difference rising: once your dough is kneaded your going to coat it all over in a little oil and stick it in a bowl that will let it rise at least one and a half times its size now youre going to cover it with plastic wrap and a towel put it in a warm place and let it rise for 45 minutes to an hour it should have risen over double its size during this rising time you want to spray or butter two bread pans i use pyrex 9x5 shaping last rise and baking: when your dough is ready dump it out and push the bubbles out of it divide it as equal as you can flatten each piece out to a rectangle about the size of the pan then roll it up tight and pinch the seams together tucking the ends inches turn over and put in the pan seam side down put the loaves in a warm place and cover with a towel let them rise from 30 minutes to
